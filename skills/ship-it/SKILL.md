# Ship-It Conductor

Run the full feature pipeline from a thumbs-upped design spec to a reviewed pull request, autonomously, in one invocation. This skill is a **pure conductor**: it sequences existing units and owns the transitions between them. It duplicates none of their logic — each unit is invoked **live**, so improvements to those units are always picked up.

**Pipeline (sequential):** harden spec → write plan → resolve branch → execute → open PR → review loop.

**Policy:** fully autonomous, best-effort, **never halt on quality**. The only hard abort is a failed preflight. A non-clean *quality* outcome (open IMPORTANTs, review notes) is recorded and the chain continues. A hard failure that makes the next step *impossible* (e.g. zero code produced → nothing to commit) skips the now-impossible steps and jumps to the final report — it never fabricates a downstream artifact.

**Underlying units (invoked live, never reimplemented):** `spec-review-codex`, `writing-plans`, `plan-to-dex` (all via the Skill tool), and the `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr` + `/review-pr` slash commands.

## The Job

1. Preflight (fail fast)
2. Step 1 — Harden the spec via `spec-review-codex`
3. Step 2 — Write the implementation plan via `writing-plans` (from the *hardened* spec)
4. Step 3 — Resolve a feature branch
5. Step 4 — Execute via `plan-to-dex` (includes its final Opus review)
6. Step 5 — Open the PR via `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr`
7. Step 6 — Review + fix loop via `/review-pr`
8. Emit the final report

Pipeline state (spec path, plan path, branch, PR number, leftover findings) lives in **conversation memory and the verifier hand-offs** — never written to disk. The only written artifact is the final report.

## Step 0: Preflight

Run these checks **before any mutation**. Preflight failure is the **only** hard abort; once past it, the never-halt policy governs.

1. **`codex` on PATH:** `command -v codex` — else STOP: "codex CLI not found; required by spec-review-codex and plan-to-dex."
2. **`dex` on PATH:** `command -v dex` — else STOP: "dex not found. Install: `curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescoalemanno/dex/main/install.sh | bash`."
3. **`pr-review-toolkit` plugin present:** the `/review-pr` command must resolve — else STOP: "pr-review-toolkit plugin not installed; required for the PR review step."
4. **`commit-commands` plugin present:** the `/commit-commands:commit-push-pr` command must resolve — else STOP: "commit-commands plugin not installed; required to open the PR."
5. **Spec located:** the argument is a path to a design spec; if omitted, find the newest `docs/superpowers/specs/*-design.md` and confirm it with the user before starting.

On any STOP, print the missing item plus its remedy and exit without touching the repo.
